1. Separate (pull apart) a black/white pair from the jumper wires.
   Cut this pair in the middle and strip 1cm of the ends on one of the
   halves.

2. Separate a brown wire from the jumper wires. Cut this wire in the
   middle and strip 1cm of the ends on both halves.
   
3. Twist the stripped black lead together with the stripped brown
   leads and solder to post "1b" on the switch (under the "1" part of
   the switch).

4. Solder the white lead to the center post of the switch.
